# How to Run Code
###

Open ‘EE219_Project1_Code.ipynb’
Part c will not affect other part, can run part c lastly
Run Code from part a to part d to get data
Three methods used in part e to part i should run separately: LSI, min_df = 2 and 5 ; NMF, min_df = 2
# Cause some parameter names are the same in different methods, if run from top to bottom, the
  parameter will be revised by other code and will lead to incorrect result. 
  That means run LSI min_df = 2 first, until part i finished. Then run LSI with min_df = 5, etc
Then get results in every parts
